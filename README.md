# Work sample for EQWorks

I attempted all problems. I am not that familiar with Spark so chose to optimise my solutions with NumPy as best I could. With a bit more time I would likely improve this by using RDDs, but I wanted to focus on solving the problems.

The solution is in a single Python file, `work_sample.py`, which only requires the `numpy` and `pandas` packages.

The file `bonus.txt` contains assumptions, hypotheses, etc. for Problem 4a.

The Jupyter Notebook file `EQWorks Data Solutions.ipynb` also contains some code demonstrating testing the hypotheses and plotting some graphs. It requires the `timezonefinder` and `networkx` packages to run (though `networkx` is only used for plotting).
